BookTrolley – Online Book Browsing Website


Project Overview:
BookTrolley is a fully designed and functional website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website serves as a digital platform where users can explore various categories of books, view book covers, and access external sources to read more about them. It simulates a real-world online bookshelf experience with interactive elements and smooth navigation.




Objective:
The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, dynamic web interface for browsing books by category. Users can:

View books by genres such as Fantasy, Poetry, Drama, Graphic Novels, and Science.

Search for book categories via the search bar and get redirected accordingly.

View a scrolling list of featured book covers at the bottom of the homepage.

Click on any book cover to navigate to a detailed page (like Wikipedia or official resources) containing the story or summary of the book.




Technologies Used:
HTML – Structure and layout of the pages

CSS – Styling, layout design, and responsiveness

JavaScript – Interactive behavior (search functionality, category toggle, dynamic redirection)




Features:
Responsive Navigation:
Users can browse through multiple book categories like:

Fantasy

Poetry

Drama

Graphic Novel

Science

Interactive Search Functionality:

Users can type the category or book-related keyword in the search bar and press Enter to be navigated directly to the respective section.

If the input does not match any existing category, a message "I am not having that type of book." is displayed on the page (instead of using disruptive alert popups).

Category-Based Page Structure:
Each category leads to a dedicated page that contains:

A curated list of book cover images.

Each image is clickable and redirects to an external site (Wikipedia or official resources) containing the book's summary or detailed information.

Auto-Collapse Category List:
A toggleable Category button reveals or hides category links for better screen space management.

Marquee Book Showcase:
A horizontally scrolling marquee at the bottom showcases featured books, enhancing visual appeal and interactivity.





How to Use:
Open Homepage.html in any modern browser.

Use the Category button or sidebar to navigate between genres.

Click on any book image to go to the book’s story or summary page.

Use the Search Bar to type a genre and press Enter:

If found → you'll be redirected to the genre’s page.

If not → the message “I am not having that type of book.” will appear on the screen.
